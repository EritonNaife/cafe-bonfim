		"title": "Our Story",
		"story": "Born in Porto's vibrant Bonfim neighborhood in 2019, we set out to create more than just another café. We wanted to build a home where locals and travelers could slow down, savor exceptional food, and connect over world-class coffee.\n\nOur founder, Sofia, spent years traveling the world's best brunch spots—from Melbourne to Copenhagen to Los Angeles—before returning to her hometown with a vision: bring that same quality and creativity to Porto, but with a distinctly Portuguese soul.\n\nToday, we're proud to serve our community with locally-sourced ingredients, specialty coffee from independent roasters, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere that feels like Sunday morning at home.",
